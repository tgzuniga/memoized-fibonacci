# memoized-fibonacci
Description: This is a C++ program that uses memoization to greatly increase the efficiency of a recursive function for finding fibonacci numbers. It also compares the run time of the memoized function with a naive version as well.

Purpose: I wrote this program to see how much of an impact memoization can have on a "bad" method of doing something, in this case finding Fibonacci numbers recursively. Memoization helps drastically by eliminating any exess function calls, and can be applied to almost any kind of set building.
