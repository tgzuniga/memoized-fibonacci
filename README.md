# memoized-fibonacci
Description: This is a C++ program that uses memoization to greatly increase the efficiency of a recursive function for finding fibonacci numbers. It also compares the run time of the memoized function with a naive version as well.

Purpose: I wrote this program to see for myself how memoization can turn a "bad" method of doing something (recursive Fibonacci), into a fairly nice method that can be applied to almost any kind of set building.
